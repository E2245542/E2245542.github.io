		<p class="auto-style1" style="height: 652px">The Teardrop of India or 
		Pearl of the Indian Ocean are among many nicknames for Sri Lanka. But a 
		more accurate description of the gorgeous nation might be the Island of 
		Rice and Curry. &nbsp; Making liberal use of local fruit, such as coconut and 
		jackfruit, seafood and an arsenal of spices, Sri Lankan cooking delivers 
		an abundance of incredible dishesSri Lankan cuisine is known for its 
		particular combinations of herbs, spices, fish, vegetables, rices, and 
		fruits. The cuisine is highly centered around many varieties of rice, as 
		well as coconut which is a ubiquitous plant throughout the country. 
		Seafood also plays a significant role in the cuisine, be it fresh fish 
		or preserved fish. As a country that was a hub in the historic oceanic 
		silk road, contact with foreign traders brought new food items and 
		cultural influences in addition to the local traditions of the country's 
		ethnic groups, all of which have helped shape Sri Lankan cuisine. 
		Influences from Indian (particularly South Indian), Indonesian and Dutch 
		cuisines are most evident with Sri Lankan cuisine sharing close ties to 
		other neighbouring South and Southeast Asian cuisines. Though Sri Lankan 
		food has parallels to South Indian food, yet it remains distinctly its 
		own form of cuisine. &nbsp; Throughout years of colonization and influence 
		from other countries, Sri Lanka has adapted its food culture into a 
		blend of different curry concoctions and tasty dishes. &nbsp; A few things 
		about Sri Lankan food can be said with certainty: Sri Lankans thoroughly 
		love spices, they love food that explodes with flavor, and many enjoy 
		deep fried, and very tasty, snacks. Whatever you choose to eat in Sri 
		Lanka, your mouth is going to rejoice with happiness. &nbsp; Sri Lanka, being 
		an island with a tropical climate, coconuts and fish are two of the most 
		influential components of Sri Lankan cuisine. Fish is made into curries, 
		and coconut in some form or another, is a dominant ingredient in 
		cooking. &nbsp; Rice and curry is the Sri Lankan staple, though various kinds 
		of bread, both roti style flatbreads and even loaves of bread, are very 
		common. Let's go to our<a href="Untitled_1.html"> Recipie Catalog.</a></p>
